# 👋 Hi, I'm Islam Abdallah Salem

### 🚀 Senior Front-End Developer | Angular & React Specialist

I'm passionate about creating interactive, responsive, and visually appealing web applications. With extensive experience in Angular, React, and modern front-end technologies, I build applications that enhance user experiences and improve user engagement.

Currently, I'm working at AFAQY, building enterprise solutions in the fleet management industry. I have a Bachelor's degree in Information Systems Security from Pharaohs Institutes. I believe in continuous learning, innovation, and sharing knowledge with the developer community.
